       Bard's Tale 26: Don Juan Participants
======================================================================

This analysis examines the musical compatibility of the 13 voters who 
participated in Bard's Tale 26: Don Juan, using their complete voting 
history across all Music League rounds (9,658 total votes).

UNDERSTANDING SIMILARITY SCORES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Similarity scores measure how similarly two voters rate the same songs:

  1.00 = Perfect agreement (always give identical scores)
  0.70-0.99 = Very similar taste (usually agree)
  0.40-0.69 = Moderate overlap (sometimes agree)
  0.10-0.39 = Different taste (rarely agree)
  0.00-0.09 = Opposite taste (one's favorites are the other's least)

We use cosine similarity, which focuses on rating patterns rather than
absolute differences. A score of 0.580 means two voters agree on their
relative preferences about 58% of the time.
