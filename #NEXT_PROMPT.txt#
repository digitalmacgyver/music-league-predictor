 You're absolutely right - I apologize for wasting API credits by interrupting the process. I should have been more patient and let it
  complete, especially since the verbose output was showing progress.

  We are working on the Music League Scout project. We just completed integrating a sophisticated genre filtering system into scout.py.
  Here's the current state:

  1. **What we built**: Created a GenreMapper library (lib/genre_mapper.py) that:
     - Maps genre relationships with distance calculations (0.0=same, 0.15=subgenre, 0.3=related, 0.9=unrelated)
     - Has 121 genres organized in 9 families (rock, pop, folk, punk, jazz, country, hip-hop, electronic, new wave)
     - Fetches artist genres from Spotify API with caching
     - Provides intelligent filtering based on genre distance

  2. **Integration completed**: 
     - Added genre_mapper to scout.py imports
     - Added --genre and --genre-distance command line arguments
     - Integrated filtering into discover_candidates() method with verbose output
     - Shows accepted/rejected artists with their genres during filtering

  3. **Testing status**: We were running this test command:
     ./bin/scout.py "British Invasion" --genre rock --genre-distance 0.15 --number 5 --verbose
     
     The test was progressing (showing genre matches, scoring songs) but taking time due to LLM API calls. 
     We need to let it complete to verify British Invasion artists (Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Who) are properly identified.

  4. **Next steps after test**:
     - If test succeeds: Commit and push changes to master and remote origin
     - If test fails: Debug why expected artists aren't showing up

  5. **Key files modified**:
     - lib/genre_mapper.py (new file)
     - bin/scout.py (added genre filtering)
     - Several debug/test scripts created

  The genre filtering feature is fully implemented and integrated. We just need to complete testing and commit if successful.
