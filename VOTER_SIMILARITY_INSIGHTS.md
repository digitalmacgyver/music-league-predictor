# Music League Voter Similarity Analysis

*Fun insights from analyzing 11,464 votes across 1,738 songs by 25 voters*

## Understanding Similarity Scores

**Similarity scores** range from 0.0 to 1.0 and measure how similarly two voters rate songs:
- **1.0 = Perfect agreement**: Always give the same scores to the same songs
- **0.8-0.9 = Very similar taste**: Usually agree on what's good/bad
- **0.5-0.7 = Moderately similar**: Some overlap in preferences
- **0.3-0.4 = Different taste**: Rarely agree on song ratings
- **0.0 = Opposite taste**: One person's favorites are the other's least favorites

*Note: We use cosine similarity, which focuses on rating patterns rather than absolute score differences*
